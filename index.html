<h3 class="floating"><strong>Welcome to a website where I leak every little part of PrimeGames, you people 
  need to know the truth, believe it, because it's true.
</strong></h3>
<hr>
<p class="fadeIn">Hello, you're probably wondering right now.. Why you're here, am I correct?
  Well the answer is simple, you're probably a member or staff of a server called primegames. 
  And I know, cuz this is right. Now, you're probably wondering who in the world would do such a
  thing to a so called "Nice and good community server" well guess what, you're fucking wrong. You
  and your server are getting fucked right now, so good luck after this website gets to every player's
  DM and not only that, once you come on this site, you're already fucked, because this site has info
  which can fuck your server up, so be warned, here out in the wild, we aren't safe, so buckle up, because 
  this is gonna be a wild one.<br>
  P.S All sources of information will be held annoynmous.
</p>
<hr>
<dd class="slideRight">Below here: I will leak all information about OptimusPrime338 aka the owner</dd>
<hr>
<p class="fadeIn">The owner here, is nothing but a selfish little scumbag, who doesn't even care about members
  or any of the staff for the matter of a fact.<br>
  This owner secretly steals information from their users, without them knowing. This owner also hires staff who were hacking
  a day before. For example, there's a hacker he hacks, then gets a day ban, next day he'll get a staff rank most likely helper,
  like think about this, how can the staff team ban hackers and make the community a better place when you have hackers as staff.
  Not only does he do this,  he also let's say "steals money", if there's a problem with the buycraft he mostly doesn't care if the 
  person wasted their money on something the owner has to fix. Not only that, staff that he banned for doing something that makes the
  community worse, he re-hires them, why you ask? Because he's sad, he needs staff, he doesn't care about their reputation or if they're good
  or bad at the task, or if they're bad in the community, he just hires them just cuz he "thinks" it'll help. Most staff quit, because this owner
  is a horrible person in general, he's a fraud. He thinks he's a "oh look at me I'm the owner, so it means I can do whatever I can.
  Like seriously, wake up? I don't see this server going any where far, if it's going like this, it's better for you guys to quit.
  Btw, all of what you read here is true, because I've gotten these from reliable sources, which will remain annonymous.
</p>
<hr>
<dd class="slideRight"> Okay enough information about OptimusPrime338, now some information about CottenMelis, another owner which got banned for 
something I'll explain in a bit, but she's back as staff</dd>
<hr>
<p class="fadeIn">Okay, so about Cottonmelis, well what can I say she got banned by OptimusPrime338 for something against him and now she's back.
  Well you're probably wondering "what has she done?". Well let me tell ya, she's made a group which personally goes against the other owner, OptimusPrime338,
  In this group, she told and explained to everyone why he's a bad owner and how he is one, but apparently, that only lasted for a month or a week, anyhow, 
  OptimusPrime338, added this person back as a staff, I mean like, if someone is ruining your reparation or your server's, then why would you make that person,
  a staff again? Someone that doesn't help the community at all. Secondly, she's not that bad of a person, don't get me wrong, it's this person, gives away free items 
  in game, not only that she makes the game like 10x more easier for some "special" players and the other players don't get any of the items she gives, this is just absurd.
  a problem really. Not much to say about here, it's just a big problem really...
</p>
<hr>
<dd class="slideRight">Okay now some information about someone who got banned a while ago for quite a lot of shit and is now a chief, tumeden:</dd>
<hr>
<p class="fadeIn">This person, is the worse of them all, and he's back as chief.. This shows how shit the server is.
  He has not only asked underage colleagues aka staff for innapropiate images, he has also stolen information from OptimusPrime338
   who's currently lying to all of his players, like the horrible person he is. Anyways like, how can a owner
   even accept staff that were bad to him before? And who are bad for the community? Like this owner really doesn't know how to
   set up a server, this server is dying, and you guys should know it.  
</p>
<hr>
<dd class="slideRight">Okay enough about some terrible staff, now about the community, players and the server in general, a basic summary.</dd>
<p class="fadeIn">So in general this server is breaking apart, about 65% of the player base are hackers, and the staff don't even know how to 
  deal with it correctly. Not only that some people that are still staff have been breaking the rules for a while, and they're still staff. 
  Someone who has constantly broken the server's rules is currently still staff, which explains how terrible this community is. The server needs
  to fix up, and everyone in this server should quit, trust me, this will help you masively, there are multiple servers that are better, not only that
  the server has issues in general, starting with all of enchants are unbalanced, the staff members are garbage, and the whole community is a piece of shit,
  we together should work together to destroy this server, and their bad and nasty staff... Like for real, be ashamed, stealing information from your players,
  and so much more, this isn't a server worth being a community of, you really need to fix up, because this is the wild, get like for real? There are some dangerous
  people out there, people you don't wanna mess with, just understand, you aren't save? You think just cuz you own a server everyone likes you?
  Hahha, don't make me laugh, that's because nobody really knows the truth, but here you have it the full truth. Be ashamed, just cuz you can't get good
  staff doesn't allow you to make hackers as staff, let alone people that you've personally banned and were trying to destroy the server.. smh. Not only that, 
  who's been abusing his powers a lot of times, is still a staff, which totally makes no sense, the owner on this server
  is a real softy and can't absolutely do nothing except ban, banning or blocking a person is the way he solves all his problems..
