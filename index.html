<h3 class="floating"><strong>Welcome to a website where I leak every little part of PrimeGames, you people 
  need to know the truth, believe it, because it's true.
</strong></h3>
<hr>
<p class="fadeIn">Hello, you're probably wondering right now.. Why you're here, am I correct?
  Well the answer is simple, you're probably a member or staff of a server called primegames. 
  And I know, cuz this is right. Now, you're probably wondering who in the world would do such a
  thing to a so called "Nice and good community server" well guess what, you're fucking wrong. You
  and your server are getting fucked right now, so good luck after this website gets to every player's
  DM and not only that, once you come on this site, you're already fucked, because this site has info
  which can fuck your server up, so be warned, here out in the wild, we aren't safe, so buckle up, because 
  this is gonna be a wild one.<br>
  P.S All sources of information will be held annoynmous.
</p>
<hr>
<dd class="slideRight">Below here: I will leak all information about OptimusPrime338 aka the owner</dd>
<hr>
<p class="fadeIn">The owner here, is nothing but a selfish little scumbag, who doesn't even care about members
  or any of the staff for the matter of a fact.<br>
  This owner secretly steals information from their users, without them knowing. This owner also hires staff who were hacking
  a day before. For example, there's a hacker he hacks, then gets a day ban, next day he'll get a staff rank most likely helper,
  like think about this, how can the staff team ban hackers and make the community a better place when you have hackers as staff.
  Not only does he do this,  he also let's say "steals money", if there's a problem with the buycraft he mostly doesn't care if the 
  person wasted their money on something the owner has to fix. Not only that, staff that he banned for doing something that makes the
  community worse, he re-hires them, why you ask? Because he's sad, he needs staff, he doesn't care about their reputation or if they're good
  or bad at the task, or if they're bad in the community, he just hires them just cuz he "thinks" it'll help. Most staff quit, because this owner
  is a horrible person in general, he's a fraud. He thinks he's a "oh look at me I'm the owner, so it means I can do whatever I can.
  Like seriously, wake up? I don't see this server going any where far, if it's going like this, it's better for you guys to quit.
  Btw, all of what you read here is true, because I've gotten these from reliable sources, which will remain annonymous.
</p>
<hr>
<dd class="slideRight"> Okay enough information about OptimusPrime338, now some information about CottenMelis, another owner which got banned for 
something I'll explain in a bit, but she's back as staff</dd>
<hr>
<p class="fadeIn">Okay, so about CottenMelis, well what can I say she got banned by OptimusPrime338 for something against him and now she's back.
  Well you're probably wondering "what has she done?". Well let me tell ya, she's made a group which personally goes against the other owner, OptimusPrime338,
  In this group, she told and explained to everyone why he's a bad owner and how he is one, but apparently, that only lasted for a month or a week, anyhow, 
  OptimusPrime338, added this person back as a staff, I mean like, if someone is ruining your reparation or your server's, then why would you make that person,
  a staff again? Someone that doesn't help the community at all. Secondly, she's not that bad of a person, don't get me wrong, it's this person, gives away free items 
  in game, not only that she makes the game like 10x more easier for some "special" players and the other players don't get any of the items she gives, this is just absurd.
  a problem really. Not much to say about here, it's just a big problem really...
